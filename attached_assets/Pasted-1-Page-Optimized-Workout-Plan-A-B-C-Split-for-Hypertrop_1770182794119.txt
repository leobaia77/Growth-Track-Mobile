1-Page Optimized Workout Plan
(A/B/C Split for Hypertrophy and Strength)

⸻

Workout A: Back, Biceps, Calves
	1.	Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown (RP)
	•	Target: 15–30 total RP reps
	•	Tip: Focus on pulling with your back rather than your arms.
	2.	One-Arm Dumbbell Row (2×12–20)
	•	Sets/Reps: 2 straight sets of 12–20 reps
	•	Tip: Keep your back flat and pull the dumbbell toward your hip.
	3.	Barbell Curl (RP)
	•	Target: 15–30 total RP reps
	•	Tip: Keep elbows tucked and avoid swaying your torso.
	4.	Standing or Seated Calf Raise (2×12–20)
	•	Sets/Reps: 2 straight sets of 12–20 reps
	•	Tip: Pause briefly at the top for peak contraction.

⸻

Workout B: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps
	1.	Flat Dumbbell Press (RP)
	•	Target: 15–30 total RP reps
	•	Tip: Maintain a slight arch in your lower back; keep shoulders retracted.
	2.	Incline Dumbbell Press (2×12–15)
	•	Sets/Reps: 2 straight sets of 12–15 reps
	•	Tip: This slightly lower rep range (vs. rest-pause) balances volume and intensity.
	3.	Dumbbell Shoulder Press (RP)
	•	Target: 15–30 total RP reps
	•	Tip: Keep elbows slightly in front of your body to protect shoulders.
	4.	Overhead Triceps Extension (RP)
	•	Target: 15–30 total RP reps
	•	Tip: Keep your upper arms close to your head; move only at the elbows.

(Note: Changing the Incline DB Press to 2 straight sets helps manage total training volume and avoid excessive fatigue from too many rest-pause sets.)

⸻

Workout C: Legs & Glutes
	1.	Barbell Squats (2×12–20)
	•	Sets/Reps: 2 straight sets of 12–20 reps
	•	Tip: Focus on depth, keeping knees in line with toes, and bracing your core.
	2.	Leg Press, Feet Close (WM)
	•	Widowmaker Set: 1×20 reps
	•	Tip: Close stance emphasizes quadriceps; push evenly through entire foot.
	3.	Romanian Deadlift (2×12–20)
	•	Sets/Reps: 2 straight sets of 12–20 reps
	•	Tip: Keep your spine neutral, hinge at the hips, and feel the stretch in your hamstrings.
	4.	Leg Curl (WM)
	•	Widowmaker Set: 1×20 reps
	•	Tip: Use a controlled tempo; avoid swinging or arching your lower back.

Abbreviations & Descriptions
	•	RP (Rest-Pause):
Perform a set close to failure (within your target rep range), rest 15–20 seconds, then continue with more reps. Repeat once more for a total of 2–3 mini-sets. You count all reps from these mini-sets together to reach the target (e.g., 15–30 total).
	•	WM (Widowmaker):
A high-rep set (usually 20 reps) taken close to failure. The goal is to challenge muscular endurance and stimulate hypertrophy.
	•	Sets x Reps:
	•	2×12–20 = 2 straight sets of 12–20 reps each, resting ~60–90 seconds in between.
	•	1×20 (WM) = 1 all-out set aiming for 20 reps.
	•	Goals & Tips for Success:
	1.	Hypertrophy & Strength: This split targets all major muscle groups with a mix of rest-pause sets (intensity) and straight sets (volume).
	2.	Progressive Overload: Gradually increase weight or reps over time to keep challenging your muscles.
	3.	Frequency: Typically performed as a 3-day rotation (A–B–C) throughout the week (e.g., Mon–Wed–Fri), ensuring rest or active recovery days between sessions.
	4.	Warm-Up: Always do 1–2 lighter warm-up sets before heavy sets, especially for compound lifts.
	5.	Form Over Weight: Prioritize controlled movements and proper technique to reduce injury risk and maximize muscle engagement.
