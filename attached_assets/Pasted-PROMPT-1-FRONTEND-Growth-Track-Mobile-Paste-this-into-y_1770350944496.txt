PROMPT 1: FRONTEND (Growth-Track-Mobile)
Paste this into your Growth-Track-Mobile Replit chat:

I had an external code audit performed on this app and the backend it connects to (Node-Post-Connect). The audit found critical issues that need your review. I need you to:

Verify each item below — check the actual code to confirm whether the issue exists as described
Flag YES or NO for each item — does it actually need fixing?
For every YES, propose a specific fix with file and line reference
Create a prioritized implementation plan grouped into phases

BLOCKER — Security Word Never Sent During Registration
File: services/api.ts, register() method
The register() function accepts a securityWord parameter but the request body sent to the backend is { email, password, displayName, role: 'user' } — the securityWord is never included. The backend IS set up to receive and hash it. This means every user who sets a security word during registration has it silently dropped, and password recovery will always fail.
Verify: Check the register() method body object. Is securityWord included in the POST body?
BLOCKER — 12 Broken API Route Paths
The standalone app uses different URL paths than what the backend actually serves. Every call below will return a 404:
Frontend callsBackend expectsAffected methodGET /api/brace-schedulesGET /api/scoliosis/brace-schedulegetBraceSchedule()POST /api/brace-schedulesPOST /api/scoliosis/brace-schedulecreateBraceSchedule()PUT /api/brace-schedules/:idPATCH /api/scoliosis/brace-schedule/:idupdateBraceSchedule()GET /api/brace-logsGET /api/scoliosis/brace-logsgetBraceLogs()GET /api/brace-logs/activeGET /api/scoliosis/brace-logs/activegetActiveBraceSession()POST /api/brace-logs/startPOST /api/scoliosis/brace-logs/startstartBraceSession()POST /api/brace-logs/:id/endPOST /api/scoliosis/brace-logs/:id/endendBraceSession()POST /api/brace-logsPOST /api/scoliosis/brace-logscreateBraceLog()GET /api/scoliosis-symptomsGET /api/scoliosis/symptomsgetSymptomLogs()POST /api/scoliosis-symptomsPOST /api/scoliosis/symptomslogSymptoms()GET /api/checkinGET /api/checkins (plural)getCheckins()GET /api/workoutGET /api/workouts (plural)getWorkoutLogs()
Verify: Open services/api.ts and check each method listed. Do the paths match what I've described?
BLOCKER — Wrong HTTP Method for Brace Schedule Update
updateBraceSchedule() sends PUT but the backend route is PATCH. Even if the path were correct, the method mismatch would cause a 404 or 405.
Verify: Check updateBraceSchedule() — does it use PUT or PATCH?
BLOCKER — Query Parameter Name Mismatch
The frontend sends startDate and endDate as query params, but the backend reads start_date and end_date. This affects: getCheckins(), getSleepLogs(), getWorkoutLogs(), getNutritionLogs(), getMentalHealthLogs(). The backend will silently ignore the params and use default date ranges.
Verify: Check the query parameter names in those GET methods and compare against the backend expectation of start_date / end_date.
BLOCKER — Two Ghost Endpoints That Don't Exist on Backend

getUserProfile() calls GET /api/user-profile — no such backend route exists
updateUserProfile() calls PUT /api/user-profile — no such backend route exists

The backend equivalent is GET /api/goals and PUT /api/goals.
Verify: Search the codebase for any usage of getUserProfile() or updateUserProfile(). Are they called anywhere? If not, they may be dead code.
HIGH — PT Adherence Path vs Query Param Mismatch
getPtAdherence(routineId) calls GET /api/pt-adherence/:routineId (path parameter). The backend expects GET /api/pt-adherence?routine_id=X (query parameter).
Verify: Check getPtAdherence() — how does it pass the routineId?
HIGH — PT Routines Uses Simpler Endpoint
getPtRoutines() calls GET /api/pt-routines which returns basic routines. The backend also has GET /api/scoliosis/routines which returns routines WITH their exercises attached. The frontend may be missing exercise data.
Verify: Check which endpoint getPtRoutines() calls and whether the app needs exercise data in the response.
HIGH — No Auth Guards on Layout Routes
From the prior frontend audit: neither app/(main)/_layout.tsx nor app/(admin)/_layout.tsx check if the user is authenticated before rendering. A user can deep-link directly to protected screens without logging in. The admin layout has zero role checking.
Verify: Check both layout files for any useEffect or redirect logic that checks for a valid token.
HIGH — Account Settings Save Does Nothing
app/(main)/settings/account.tsx — the handleSave() function only calls router.back() without sending the updated displayName or email to the backend.
Verify: Check handleSave() — does it call any API method before navigating back?
HIGH — Sharing Settings Not Persisted
app/(main)/settings/sharing.tsx — privacy toggle state is local React state only. handleSave() calls router.back() with no API call or AsyncStorage write.
Verify: Check if toggle changes are saved anywhere.
MEDIUM — HealthKit Is Entirely Fake
services/healthKit.ts returns Math.random() fabricated data. No native HealthKit module is installed. The backend has a real POST /api/health-sync endpoint ready to receive HealthKit data, but the frontend never calls it with real data.
Verify: Check services/healthKit.ts — are the methods returning real native data or random numbers? Is react-native-health in package.json?
MEDIUM — No Frontend UI for Required Backend Features
The backend has endpoints the frontend never calls. Some are required for App Store compliance:

DELETE /api/account — account deletion (Apple requires this)
GET /api/export-data — data export
POST /api/push-token — push notification registration
POST /api/onboarding/complete — onboarding completion flag

Verify: Search the codebase for any calls to these endpoints. Are there UI screens for account deletion or data export?
MEDIUM — No Password Validation on Registration Screen
The registration screen only checks that the password is non-empty. The backend requires minimum 8 characters. Users can enter "a" as a password on the frontend and get a confusing backend error.
Verify: Check app/(auth)/register.tsx — what password validation exists before the API call?

After verifying all items, please create an implementation plan with:

Phase 1 (Critical): All route path fixes, security word fix, query param fixes — these prevent the app from working at all
Phase 2 (Security): Auth guards, settings persistence, password validation
Phase 3 (Features): Account deletion UI, data export UI, push token registration, HealthKit decision
